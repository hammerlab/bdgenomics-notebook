# A Walk Through ADAM's Avro Schemas

This [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/) is meant to introduce you to the various datatypes used with ADAM to process next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.

To get up and running, simply start the iPython notebook in this directory with `ipython notebook` and open the notebook.

ADAM uses [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/) to specify its datatypes, and thus you must have the `avro` Python package installed in order to run this tutorial. The easiest way to do this is with `[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) install avro`.
